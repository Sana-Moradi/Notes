# What is SDLC?

The software development lifecycle (SDLC) is the cost-effective and time-efficient process that development teams use to design and build high-quality software.
The goal of SDLC is to minimize project risks through forward planning so that software meets customer expectations during production and beyond. 

 ## Here are some benefits of SDLC:

Increased visibility of the development process for all stakeholders involved
Efficient estimation, planning, and scheduling
Improved risk management and cost estimation
Systematic software delivery and better customer satisfaction

# How does SDLC work?

The software development lifecycle (SDLC) outlines several tasks required to build a software application. 
The development process goes through several stages as developers add new features and fix bugs in the software.
The details of the SDLC process vary for different teams. However, we outline some common SDLC phases below.

1. Plan
2. Design
3. Implement
4. Test
5. Deploy
6. Maintain
